abstract: "This study provides the relationship between socioeconomic factors and hate crimes across U.S. states using a Bayesian hierarchical framework. We analyze a dataset capturing hate crime incidence alongside state-level socioeconomic indicators such as median income, unemployment rates, and income inequality. Results reveal that higher income inequality and unemployment rates are associated with elevated hate crime rates, while higher median income is inversely related. These findings emphasize the need for targeted socioeconomic interventions to mitigate hate crime prevalence."

# Introduction

Hate crimes remain a significant social issue in the United States, threatening community safety and equality. These crimes disproportionately affect marginalized groups and undermine social trust. Existing research identifies socioeconomic factors—such as income inequality, unemployment, and education—as potential contributors to hate crime prevalence. However, most studies overlook state-specific variations in these relationships, limiting the understanding of how regional disparities influence hate crime patterns. This paper uses data sourced from @hatecrimesdata, which provides detailed state-level hate crime statistics alongside socioeconomic indicators, to explore these relationships rigorously.

This paper investigates the effect of state-level socioeconomic factors on hate crime rates. The estimand is the average marginal effect of variables, including income inequality, unemployment, and education levels, on hate crimes per 100,000 population. A Bayesian hierarchical model is employed to account for regional heterogeneity, allowing for more precise estimation of these effects.

The results demonstrate that states with higher income inequality and unemployment rates report more hate crimes, while higher median income and education levels are associated with reduced hate crime prevalence. These findings emphasize the socioeconomic disparities that contribute to hate crime patterns, suggesting the importance of addressing inequality and unemployment at the state level.

Understanding the socioeconomic determinants of hate crimes is essential for informing policies aimed at reducing their prevalence. This analysis provides evidence for the role of structural inequality and economic conditions in shaping hate crime patterns, offering a foundation for targeted policy interventions to foster safer and more equitable communities.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. @sec-data describes the dataset, variables, and preprocessing steps. Section 3 outlines the methodological framework, including the Bayesian hierarchical model. Section 4 presents the results, accompanied by tables and visualizations. Section 5 discusses the implications, limitations, and potential future directions of the analysis. Section 6 concludes with a summary of the key findings and recommendations.


# Data {#sec-data}

## Overview

This study employs R [@citeR] for cleaning and analyzing the dataset, using libraries such as `dplyr` [@tidyverse], `ggplot2` [@ggplot2], and `arrow` [@arrow]. The dataset, sourced from [@hatecrimesdata], explores the relationships between socioeconomic variables and hate crime prevalence in the United States. It includes aggregated data for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

After preprocessing, which involved filtering missing values and standardizing key variables, the final analysis dataset consists of **51** observations across **7** key variables: `state`, `median_income`, `unemployment_rate`, `metro_area_population_share`, `high_school_education_share`, `gini_index`, and `non_white_population_share`. These variables capture essential socioeconomic conditions and their potential influence on hate crime rates, measured as `hate_crimes_per_100k_splc`.

## Measurement and Considerations 

The dataset focuses on measuring the influence of socioeconomic factors on hate crimes. Hate crime data is aggregated from credible sources, including the SPLC and FBI, and represents the prevalence of reported hate crimes per 100,000 residents.

### Data Source and Quality Assurance

The dataset was obtained from FiveThirtyEight[@hatecrimesdata], a trusted source recognized for its rigorous data quality standards. Each state-level observation documents essential socioeconomic and hate crime metrics, including income, unemployment, and population composition.

To ensure comparability across states, socioeconomic indicators were standardized and checked for consistency. Hate crime data, while robust, is subject to underreporting and reporting bias, requiring careful interpretation.

### Temporal and Geographic Context

The dataset provides a snapshot of state-level hate crime and socioeconomic data for a single year. While this ensures temporal consistency, it limits the ability to analyze trends over time. Additionally, regional disparities, such as differences in reporting standards or enforcement, may influence observed hate crime rates.

## Variables of Interest

The analysis examines the relationships between `hate_crimes_per_100k_splc` (the outcome variable) and the following socioeconomic predictors. Below, we describe each variable and present visualizations to illustrate its distribution and relevance.

### Outcome Variable: Hate Crimes Per 100k SPLC

The outcome variable is the number of hate crimes per 100,000 residents, as reported by the SPLC. Its distribution, shown in @fig-hate-crimes, highlights variation across states, with most states reporting between 0.1 and 0.5 hate crimes per 100,000 residents. The variability suggests that some states experience disproportionately higher rates of hate crimes.

# Model {#sec-modelsetup}

The goal of our modelling strategy is twofold. Firstly,...

Here we briefly describe the Bayesian analysis model used to investigate... Background details and diagnostics are included in [Appendix -@sec-model].

## Model set-up

Define $y_i$ as the number of seconds that the plane remained aloft. Then $\beta_i$ is the wing width and $\gamma_i$ is the wing length, both measured in millimeters.  

\begin{align} 
y_i|\mu_i, \sigma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(\mu_i, \sigma) \\
\mu_i &= \alpha + \beta_i + \gamma_i\\
\alpha &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\beta &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\gamma &\sim \mbox{Normal}(0, 2.5) \\
\sigma &\sim \mbox{Exponential}(1)
\end{align}

We run the model in R [@citeR] using the `rstanarm` package of @rstanarm. We use the default priors from `rstanarm`.


### Model justification

We expect a positive relationship between the size of the wings and time spent aloft. In particular...

We can use maths by including latex between dollar signs, for instance $\theta$.

	- The dataset contains 51 rows, representing all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*

If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms?*
	- Potential issues include:
	Aggregated data might mask localized trends or nuances.
	Bias in reporting (e.g., differences between SPLC and FBI data) might skew results.
	Care must be taken to avoid stereotyping regions or groups based on hate crime rates.
	To mitigate risks, dataset consumers should validate findings with supplementary sources and consider regional or temporal biases in the data.
5. *Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset should not be used to draw conclusions about individual-level behaviors or characteristics, as it is aggregated at the state level.
	It should also not be used to make causal inferences without careful statistical validation.
